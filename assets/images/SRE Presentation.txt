Requirements 

Requirements are specifications that describe the features, capabilities, and characteristics of a system or product. 

Quality goals:

Quality goals are specific, measurable objectives or standards that are established to ensure that a product or system meets certain criteria of quality. 
These goals are set during the early stages of a project, often in the requirements phase, and they serve as benchmarks for evaluating 
and ensuring the quality of the end result. 
Quality goals, on the other hand, are criteria or standards that define the expected level of quality for the end result. 
Integrating quality goals into the requirements process helps ensure that the final product meets certain standards and satisfies the needs of stakeholders.

Role of quality goals

Following are the role of quality goals in the requirenments:
-Measurable Metrics:
-Define Acceptance Criteria
-Guidance for Design and Development
-Alignment with Stakeholder Expectations
-Risk Mitigation
-Continuous Improvement
-Measuring Success
-Facilitating Communication
-Enhancing User Satisfaction

Measurable Metrics:

Quality goals are often associated with measurable metrics. By integrating these metrics into the requirements, 
you provide a basis for objective evaluation of the product's quality. This measurability allows for ongoing assessment and adjustment throughout 
the development process.

Define Acceptance Criteria:

Quality goals help define the acceptance criteria for the project. 
These criteria specify the minimum standards that the product must meet to be considered acceptable by stakeholders. 
By incorporating quality goals into requirements, you set clear expectations for the level of quality that the final product should achieve.

Guidance for Design and Development:

Quality goals serve as guidelines for designers and developers. 
They provide a framework for making decisions throughout the development process. When the development team understands the quality goals, 
they can make design and implementation choices that align with these goals, resulting in a product that meets specified quality standards.

Alignment with Stakeholder Expectations:

Quality goals are often derived from stakeholder expectations. Including these goals in the requirements ensures that the project team understands and 
incorporates the priorities and preferences of stakeholders. This alignment helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that the end product 
meets the needs and expectations of those who will use or benefit from it.

Risk Mitigation:

Quality goals can also help identify potential risks early in the project. By defining quality expectations upfront, project teams can proactively address 
potential challenges and risks that may impact the achievement of these goals. This proactive approach contributes to overall project success.

Continuous Improvement:

Quality goals contribute to a culture of continuous improvement. As the project progresses, the team can use the established quality goals as a benchmark 
for assessing the product's progress. This assessment can lead to adjustments in the requirements or development processes to ensure that quality is 
maintained or improved.

Measuring Success:

Quality goals provide measurable criteria for evaluating the success of the project. They serve as benchmarks against which the final product can be assessed. 
Measuring success against these goals helps determine whether the project has achieved its objectives.

Facilitating Communication:

Quality goals serve as a communication tool between different stakeholders. They provide a common language for discussing and evaluating the quality aspects 
of the product. This clarity in communication helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding 
of quality expectations.

Enhancing User Satisfaction:

Usability refers to the ease with which users can interact with and use a product to achieve their goals effectively and efficiently. Quality role play a key role in enhancing 
user satisfaction by focusing on aspects such as aesthetics, feedback mechanisms, and overall user enjoyment.
